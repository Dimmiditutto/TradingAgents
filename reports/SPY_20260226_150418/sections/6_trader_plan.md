Summary view
I agree with the bear-leaning plan. SPY’s trend still has bullish elements, but valuation (TTM ~27.8x), narrow breadth/concentration, tentative momentum (MACD still negative, histogram only small positive), and elevated ATR create asymmetric risk where downside outcomes materially outweigh near-term upside. Given those facts and the practical trading rules you supplied, the prudent action is to reduce unhedged SPY exposure now and only re-enter on clearer confirmation or materially cheaper prices.

Concrete recommendation (action)
- If you are currently long unhedged SPY: SELL enough to reduce exposure to a level you can tolerate through a 10–20% drawdown. For most meaningful risk-on positions, that means cutting at least 50% of the unhedged holding immediately. If you prefer a numeric guideline, reduce unhedged exposure to 25–50% of the prior position size depending on your risk tolerance.
- If you want to keep market exposure: rotate part of the proceeds into less mega-cap concentrated exposures (example: RSP or a value/size-tilt ETF) or cash equivalents. Don’t replace dollar-for-dollar into another concentrated high-valuation bet.
- If you insist on keeping any SPY exposure: implement a simple hedge rather than relying on stops alone:
  - Collar: sell an OTM call (near-term, 30–45 days) and buy an OTM put (30–60 days) sized to protect the retained position; or
  - Put spread: buy a put ~3–6% OTM and sell a lower strike put ~6–12% OTM to cap cost while keeping defined protection.

Execution rules and risk controls
- Position sizing: cut unit size in the current elevated ATR regime (recommend risking ~0.5X your normal per-unit dollar risk until volatility compresses).
- Stop/invalidation: define a clear invalidation for any residual long: a decisive daily close below the 50-day with accelerating downside momentum = exit remaining position (do not “wait it out”).
- Avoid adding on dips unless both conditions hold: (a) a hedge is in place, and (b) price reaches a level where reward/risk is attractive (see re-entry triggers).
- Event risk: do not carry unhedged material size through CPI/PCE/Fed decisions or the mega-cap earnings cluster.

Re-entry triggers (when to be constructive again)
- Momentum-confirmation route: SPY closes above the recent highs (~696–697 area referenced) with RSI > 60 and MACD clearly turning positive (not just a tiny histogram uptick).
- Value/technical reset route: SPY stabilizes and forms a base nearer the 200-day (~650 area referenced) with signs of breadth recovery — that materially improves risk/reward.

Lessons applied (what I’ll avoid this time)
- Do not over-rely on “still above the 50/200” in a narrow, high-valuation tape.
- Do not treat a tiny MACD histogram uptick as confirmation — require stronger momentum evidence.
- Use hedges or smaller sizes rather than broad, unhedged long exposure at current pricing.

Net decision
Reduce unhedged SPY exposure now; preserve optionality via hedges or rotation into less concentrated exposures. I prefer cutting at least half of unhedged exposure immediately and implementing one of the simple hedges above if you keep any long.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**

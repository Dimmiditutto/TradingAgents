Key points from the bull side
They’re leaning on the market’s structural uptrend: SPY is well above the 200-day (and the 50-day is above the 200-day), which is typically a favorable backdrop. Tactically, they argue the 686–688 zone (10 EMA/50 SMA/VWMA) is a clean, tradable “decision area” where you can buy a pullback with defined risk. They also argue the AI/capex cycle can continue to support earnings over the next 12–24 months, and SPY’s liquidity makes it an efficient core vehicle. Their risk controls are thoughtful: ATR-based stops, volume confirmation for breakouts, and optional hedges (put spreads/collars).

Key points from the bear side
They’re not disputing the uptrend; they’re disputing the entry timing and the payoff profile at today’s valuation and breadth. The most compelling bear argument is the combination of (1) rich valuation (P/E ~28) which makes the index sensitive to rates/multiple compression, (2) narrow leadership/concentration which raises fragility, and (3) cooled momentum + unimpressive participation (MACD slightly negative, RSI neutral, VWMA near price) which often leads to chop or a correction rather than clean continuation. Importantly, the bear offers a rule-based framework: don’t short blindly—wait for a break below 686–688 plus momentum confirmation; otherwise, if you want exposure, hedge it.

My recommendation: Sell (specifically: do not initiate a fresh unhedged long; reduce/avoid adding SPY here unless hedged. If you must hold exposure, keep it smaller and protected.)

Rationale (why I’m choosing the bear)
The bull’s case is basically “trend is up, buy the pullback at confluence, AI tailwinds.” That’s reasonable, but it doesn’t answer the bear’s core point: at a ~28 multiple with narrow leadership, the asymmetry for new money is not great unless you’re getting paid with either (a) a materially better entry, or (b) explicit convexity/hedging.

The bear’s argument wins because it integrates valuation + breadth + momentum into a timing call. The technical picture isn’t screaming “add risk”: MACD is still slightly negative, RSI is neutral, and volume confirmation is not evident. In that setup, I’ve seen (and made) the mistake of treating “above the 200-day” as a green light to add—only to sit through a drawdown or get chopped out when the first real momentum break hits. Here, the downside paths are clearer than the upside paths: a break of 686–688 can accelerate toward 675 and potentially 650 (the 200-day area), while upside from ~693 to ~700 is comparatively limited before you run into “sell the high” behavior again. That’s poor immediate risk/reward for a fresh, naked buy.

Also, “AI capex lifts all boats” may be directionally true, but it’s not guaranteed to broaden earnings fast enough to justify today’s multiple if rates stay higher-for-longer. When the market is priced for a lot going right, I want either stronger momentum confirmation or cheaper pricing before committing.

Strategic actions (concrete plan to implement)

1) If you currently have no SPY position
Do not buy SPY outright here.
Instead choose one of these two paths:

Path A: Wait-and-act (preferred)
- No position until one of these happens:
  - Bullish confirmation: a daily close above ~700 with clearly above-average volume and improving MACD (not just a barely-positive histogram). Then you can buy, because the market is proving it can absorb supply at the highs.
  - Bearish confirmation: a daily close below 686–688 AND MACD histogram turns negative AND RSI slips below ~50. Then you can short tactically or buy put spreads targeting 675 first, then 650–655.

Path B: If you must be involved now, use defined risk (options)
- Buy a 1–2 month put spread as the primary expression (bearish/defensive), or if you’re mildly bullish but cautious, use a collar-like approach (small SPY position + put spread).
- The goal is to avoid the classic mistake of being “sort of right” on direction but losing money through a fast downdraft or chop.

2) If you already hold SPY long (core exposure)
Treat this as a risk-reduction moment, not an add point.
- Cut the position down to a size you can hold through a 5–10% drawdown without being forced out.
- Add a 1–2 month put spread sized to meaningfully offset a 3–7% pullback. (You don’t need perfection; you need survivability.)
- Use a clear line in the sand: if SPY closes below 686–688 and the momentum confirms (MACD hist negative / RSI < 50), reduce further or fully exit and flip tactical.

3) If you want a tactical short (only on trigger)
- Entry: only after a daily close below 686–688 with momentum confirmation (as bear specified).
- Stop: about 1 ATR (~8 points) above the breakdown level, or back above the 50-day with a buffer.
- Targets: scale at 675 area first; leave a runner for 650–655 if selling pressure persists.

4) Risk management rules (this is where I’m explicitly correcting “past mistakes”)
You didn’t provide any past reflections, so I’m going to guard against the most common ones I see in this exact setup:
- Don’t “average down” if 686–688 breaks. That level is the whole trade thesis for bulls; if it fails, treat it as regime change, not a bargain.
- Don’t use a stop that is tighter than market volatility (ATR ~8). Too-tight stops guarantee whipsaws. Size smaller instead of using overly tight stops.
- Don’t wait for the 200-day to act. That’s a long way down; you can lose a lot of P&L while still being “technically in an uptrend.”

5) What would change my mind to Buy
- A broadening/participation signal: stronger volume on up days, improving market breadth (not just mega-caps), and MACD turning up convincingly.
- Or a better price: a pullback toward major support (closer to 650–670) that resets risk/reward, ideally with stabilization signals.

Net: I’m aligning with the bear. The market can still go up, but at this price/valuation with momentum cooling, the higher-quality trade is to avoid fresh, unhedged longs and either (a) wait for confirmation, or (b) stay involved only with defined-risk hedged structures.
